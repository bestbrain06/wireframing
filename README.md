# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product, such as a website or mobile application. It focuses on layout, structure, and functionality rather than design details like colors, fonts, or images. Think of it as the blueprint of your project â€” showing how content and elements will be organized.

## Importance in the Design Process
Wireframes play a crucial role in the early stages of the design process. They help:

- **Clarify ideas**: Turn abstract concepts into tangible visuals.  
- **Establish structure**: Define content hierarchy and user flow before diving into detailed design.  
- **Save time and resources**: Identify potential issues early, avoiding costly revisions later.  
- **Facilitate collaboration**: Provide a clear reference point for discussions between designers, developers, and stakeholders.
